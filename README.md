## Overview

Writing $LaTeX$ code can be tedious; `texonomy` makes it easier. This tool
generates entity-relationship diagrams in $LaTeX$ using a beginner-friendly
Python interface, so you can spend less time wrestling with missing semicolons.

In order to output as a PDF, you'll need to install some software that includes
`pdflatex`, like TeX Live.

*An entity-relationship diagram is more of an ontology than a taxonomy, but
when the shoe fits...
